                                    <h2>The short version</h2>
                                    <p>We are a small team of three guys and one girl good at designing and crafting things like logos, business cards, brochures, posters, flyers - and the mother of them all: websites! We also offer web scraping services. The general idea of this website is to show you what we do and how, if you sign up for our services, we can help your business grow. But this section isn't about the services we offer. There's the <a href="services.html">services</a> section for that. This is about us. Read on!</p>
                                    <h2>The long version</h2>
                                    <p>We are a small group of designers and developers committed to creating carefully designed products that are intended to put our clients ahead of their competition. We create things that clients can use to promote their brand, products and services both on the web and in print.</p>
                                    <p>Each one of us has their own area of expertise but we all share a passion for one thing: design. In a world where businesses are striving to have a unique aspect that gives them the upper hand, design plays a very important role. People respond positively to things that are nice to look at and easy to use. It's that simple. If you have a website that is pleasing to the eyes and easy to use then there is a high chance that it will do what it was created to do, whether it's to promote your personal image or that of your business.</p>
                                    <p>We actually have a passion for what we do. It's not all about the money. We believe that our clients' needs - no matter how big or small - deserve our full attention. Whether we're tasked with designing a simple logo or designing and developing a full-blown e-commerce website that is SEO-ready and equipped with the latest analytics capabilities, our goal is not just to finish the work on time but to build something that actually does what it's meant to do, is good to look at and, on top of that, easy to use, update and maintain. This, you'll find, gives you enough time and energy to focus on what truly matters: your products, services and your clients.</p>
                                    <h3>How we work</h3>
                                    <p>All the jobs we do are contract-based. When a client expresses an interest in having something designed, - be it a logo, poster, business card, website, or any other item in our services section - he or she is issued with a legally binding contract document (which you can find <a href="contract.pdf">here</a>) </p>
