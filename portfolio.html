                                            myself a beautiful, simple logo which looked good in colour as it did in black and white. Since then these are my go to guys for most of my design stuff.</p>

                                            of designs in Photoshop over several meetings we had in the following days. I liked the designs and he went on to build the website, integrating it into Wordpress so that we could be doing updates ourselves.
                                            He made the whole process seem so much simpler and quicker than I had thought initially.</p>

                                        <p>I'm the Minister at a small church in Shimoni, South Coast. VPDWEB have been very invaluable in helping me design a series of advertisement material for church functions. The great thing about our relationship is
                                            that we rarely have to meet face to face. I simply call them up, tell them what I need, and a few email attachments later we settle on a final design which they quickly print, package and send over by post.
                                            It's that simple. Their rates are also affordable compared to the people I've dealt with in the past.</p>
