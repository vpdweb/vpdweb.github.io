Gist: A series of static html, css and javascript files were converted into an installable Wordpress theme. To make any additions or deletions, a good understanding of html, css and a bit of javascript is necessary. An understanding of the standard Wordpress theme structure is also necessary.
NB: I've used the common Lorem Ipsum Latin text placeholders in places you need to replace with appropriate text.

1. Installation

- Log in to the admin area of Wordpress, go to Appearance -> themes -> Add New -> Upload Theme -> Browse
- Select the theme package file [charitytheme.zip] and click on 'Install Now'
- Once the theme is installed, click on 'activate'. Previewing the theme will take you to a blank page. This is because Wordpress defaults to showing you a list of posts initially. The theme has no posts template. It has a home page template which we need to register with Wordpress.
- You need to make some changes to the way Wordpress handles and displays content.
    - Quickly go to Pages -> Add new
    - Create a blank page called "Home". Under the 'Page Attributes' section, go to templates and select 'home'. Click 'Publish'. This will be our home page.
    - Right in the Admin dashboard, go to settings -> reading
    - In the 'Front page displays' option select 'A static page' -> 'Front page' then select "Home". This will tell Wordpress to display our home page template in the home page section of the site.
    - Click on 'save' at the bottom. You can now preview the site.

2. Making Changes

A. Social icons
---------------
The social icons are located in the top bar, right corner; and in the footer section on the left-most column.
To add social icons in the top bar (part of the header section), open [header.php] in the theme's root directory and locate the follwing html comment:

     <!-- TOP BAR SOCIAL ICONS -->

The social icons are wrapped in a <div> with class "header__social". Locate the <i> html element and change the icon class to any icon class you want. The theme uses font-awesome icons to display social icons. To add an Instagram social icon, for example, add the following <i> element:

        <i class="fa fa-instagram"></i>

B. Social icon links
---------------------
All social icons are wrapped in an anchor tag whose href attribute can be changed to point to the right social link. For example, to change the facebook link, locate the <i> html element with class "fa fa-facebook", and change the value of its parent anchor tag <a> to point to the correct facebook profile link, e.g. www.facebook.com/[your profile]

C. Logo
--------
To add a custom logo, go to the theme's [img] folder and replace the theme's default logo files with your own files bearing the same names. Important files to replace are:
    - icon-logo.svg [the main logo]
    - icon-logo-mob.svg [the logo that will be used on mobile displays]
    - favicon.ico [for use by browsers]
    - apple-icon.png [for retina displays]

D. Slider images
----------------
To change the slider images, go to the [img] folder in your theme's root directory, then replace the files in the [slider] folder. Note down the names of the new images because we'll need to link to them in the main slider component. Open the [home.php] template file in the theme's root directory. Locate the following html comment:

    <!-- SLIDER COMPONENT: Uses slick js -->

Replace the filename parts that are in the "/img/slider/slide[n].jpg" snippet with the appropriate image file names. Leave the "img/lazy-image.jpg" parts alone.

E. Next Upcoming Event Countdown timer
--------------------------------------
The theme uses a jquery plugin called jQuery Countdown to initiate and monitor the countdown timer even on page close and re-open. The countdown display is styled in the theme's "style.css" file in case you need to change its appearance. To change the timer's "end date" data (the date it starts counting down from), open [home.php] and locate the following html comment:

    <!-- NEXT EVENT COUNTDOWN COMPONENT: Uses jQuery countdown -->

Look for a <div> with an id of "clock". What we need change is the [data-end-date] attribute. Change the date to the event's start date, e.g. "2017/05/25" following the YYYY/MM/DD format.
You can make the necessary changes to the event's photo, title, description and start date by changing the appropriate html text.

F. Latest Events section
-------------------------
This section contains a big background photo and three "latest events" info cards. To make changes go to the following html comment in the [home.php] file: 

    <!-- LATEST EVENTS COMPONENT -->

Change all the data-href attributes to the appropriate link values. The links are inserted by Wordpress's php scripts dynamically. Change the appropriate php code snippets to whatever you want, e.g: 

    <div data-id='2' data-href="<?php get_site_url(); ?>/all_events.php" ...
    or
    <a href="<?php echo get_site_url(); ?>/event_title.php">Event Title</a></h3>
NB: You will need to create the all_events.php and event_title.php flies first to avoid dead links.

Alternatively, remove all anchor [<a>] tags to remove the links and let site visitors just see the latest events information.
The Video icon is an SVG icon that should be used to take the visitor to a video watching site like youtube when clicked. It is simple to insert such a link. For example, to attach a youtube video link to one of the icons use the following code:

    <div class="latest_event__links">
        <a href="[insert youtube video url here]" class="latest_event__link-item js-latest_event-video">
            <svg class="latest_event__link-svg">
                <use xlink:href="#icon-video"></use>
            </svg>
        </a>
    </div>

To change the background photo open the theme's [style.css] file, use your code editor's find utility to look for the ".widget--latest_event" class selector and change the background url to your image's url, e.g:

    .widget--latest_event {
    background: url("img/[mycoolbackgroundimage.jpg]") 50% 0 no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    }

G. The "Big Title" two-column component
---------------------------------------
These two-column image + text content layouts are appropriate for displaying things like "Our services" or "Product features" sections in modern websites. To change the feature images, go to [style.css] and search for  ".feature__picture_left" and ".feature__picture_right" css class selectors and change their background url attributes accordingly.

H. Members section
-------------------
Most organisation websites display member profiles for viewing by site visitors. To edit the "Our Members" section, go to the following html comment on the theme's [home.php] file:

    <!-- ORGANISATION MEMBERS COMPONENT -->

Make changes to the title and introductory texts. Each member profile part is wrapped in a <div> with class "listing__item". To change the member profile photos, you need to edit each profile part's <img> href attribute. It looks something like this:

    <img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/img/members/member-1.jpg" ...

Add your member proflie photos to the [img/members] folder in your theme, then change the images [src] attribute accordingly, e.g:

    <img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/img/members/mr_john_paul.jpg"

Under each member profile part, you'll find a social icons area that you can use to display social icons. Add, remove and edit the info as much as you need.

I. Organisation projects area
------------------------------ 
Most organisations have past, on-going and future projects. This section is excellent for showcasing all the important organisation projects. To edit the info in this section, locate the following html comment in the [home.php] file:

    <!-- ORGANISATION PROJECT COMPONENT -->

Editing this section is the same as the above section. Just make sure you insert the right image source attribute values.

J. Testimonials and Organisation Partners slide components
-----------------------------------------------------------
The theme uses the excellent slick.js carousel plugin to create the awesome slideshows you see on the page. The plugins homepage can be found at https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/

To change the slideshow images, locate the following html comment sections:

    <!-- TESTIMONIALS SLIDE COMPONENT -->

and

    <!-- ORGANIZATION PARTNERS SLIDE COMPONENT -->

Change the img [src] attributes accordingly.
To change the slideshow properties, open the [js/app.js] file in your code editor and look for the comment section that says, 

    /*
     Slick slider functionality
     */

The main slider and the testimonial slider use the same slide properties, i.e. one image or testimonial at a time and a three second delay (3000 milli seconds) between slides.
The partners slider on the other hand uses extra different properties: six slides at a time and one image per slide transition.
You can tweak these properties to suit your needs, or even add more properties after reading slick's documentation.
